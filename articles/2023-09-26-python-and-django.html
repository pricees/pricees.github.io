          Over the last 15 years of my Rails career I have, in fits and spurts,
          learned Python enought to be dangerous but not enought to be a native
          speaker. However, noww that the results are in and Python is clearly
          the go to for damn near everything ("It's the 2nd most popular
          language for everything") I feel like it's incumbent on me to learn.
          So here I am taking some introductor courses on Python and Django.
          Then I will head off into the world of Numpy/SciPy/Matplotlib and all
          the other libraries that the cool kids are using.

          Types

          The first thing that I noticed is that Python requires you to know a
          few more types: sets, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
          It forces you to know these by using them it self for args and kwargs,
          returns from Django libraries etc.
          And while Ruby has sets, the reality is that most of the time, in
          Ruby, ones togo data structures are List and Dictionary. I dare say
          the average rubyist does not know the difference between a Tuple and a
          Lsit/Array, let alone other data structures, and why should we? 

          One Way To Do Everything

          I love Ruby and like it's expressiveness. Python has, essentially one
          way to do each thing. What is interesting is that if you are using a
          Ruby linter like Rubocop or have many authors of the same code base,
          my gut is that the artistic and expressive nature of Ruby with regress
          to the most practical and intuitive

          Closures, Lamddas, Functional Programming

          I like Ruby's syntax for these better and when one gets bit by the
          functional bug Ruby really shines for it's express declarative
          chaining.

          Python is able to do much of this as well but Ruby takes the edge.

          Passing (self) to everything in Python?

          I find this a bit weird. It doesn't inhibit the ability to write code,
          but it seems like if I am going to be required to add self to every
          class/method, I should also be able to pass an arbitrary
          binding/context.
